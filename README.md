###Difference between the *new* and *override* annotations.

After the declarison of a method as *virtual*
and then overriding it in its child with the *override* keyword 
against simply using the *new* keyboard when declaring it it's 
basically *override* is literally rewriting the method inherited
from the main class since *new* is just creating a new method with
the same name as in the main class although it's not referenced to
 it, because it's just a new member with the same name and clauses.
